8-Pin Matrix FONT

This font looks very much like the output of an 8-Pin dot-matrix printer.
It must be distributed under the archive name
8PINM-T1 (8PN-T1 on Compuserve) for the PostScript format
8PINM-TT (8PN-TT on Compuserve) for the TrueType format
together with all it's accompanying files.

This font is shareware. If you like it, and decide to continue to use it, you
must register. See following chapters about details. See also "Great Fonts
Offer" document and discover how, by registering, you will get 50 exclusive
fonts to thank-you for paying the very low registration an usage fee.

A bit of nostalgy

Back in 1987, I was working with a now antique Apple IIe and a then brand new
Apple IIc, as well as an IBM-PC clone (Panasonic Senior Partner) on a project
that was to become MatchFont. That software allowed machines of the time to
use fonts on dot-matrix printers, such as the good old Epson FX-80 I had then,
or the Apple Imagewriter.  Eventualy, MatchFont helped people to use fonts on
these rather slow printers, and to get unusual fonts, at least for these 
character-based computers. Eventually, the printers got even slower, but the 
results where, at least at the time, better than even a Mac.

To-day, these technological monsters are gone. But I still remember the long
hours passed on the 9x18 matrix of the MatchFont editor. I then created some 
great marvels, such as Japanese, or a sideways font.

8-Pin Matrix reminded me of that good'ol time, as while creating it, I found
back the familiar limitations of that format.

I hope you will find interesting this little font, looking very much like the 
FX-80 outputs.

As this is meant to really look like the output from an old dot-matrix
printer, do not be surprised if you do not find kerninbg or proportional
characters spacing. All this was still science fiction, at the time. So, this
font offers monospace, and no kerning. Incidently, it means it will work as
well a did, before, monospaced printed output, especially for numbers and
spreadsheet.

Thank-you in advance for any comment and suggestions you may have. In
particular, if you have a favorite written or printed representation you may
want to have made as a font, please send it along with your registration. It
will take place in the project file folder, and if I follow-up on your
suggestion, you will get this brand new font for free !

INSTALLATION
""""""""""""
1) TRUETYPE
After de-compacting the archive, copy the file *.TTF in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. Then, use the standard Microsoft Control
Panel to install the new font.

For more details about how to install new fonts under Windows 3.1
and more recent, or under compatible environments, refer to the
Microsoft Windows manual, or Microsoft technical support.

2 ) POSTSCRIPT TYPE 1

Copy the appropriate files in the corresponding directories :*.PFM in \PFM,
and so on. Then, use the Adobe Type Manager control panel to add the new
installed font.

If you need any help with PostScript fonts installation in windows, please
refer to your Adobe Type Manager manual, or Adobe technical support.

DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying it. 
If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are expected to 
register. Individual programs differ on details -- some request registration 
while others require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With 
registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue using the 
software to an updated program with printed manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and the 
copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as stated 
below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like 
commercial authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both 
cases, there are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the 
method of distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and 
distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For 
example, some authors require written permission before a commercial disk 
vendor may copy their Shareware (see enclosed VENDOR.DOC).

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should find 
software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's commercial or 
Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because 
you can try before you buy. And because the overhead is low, prices are low 
also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the 
product, you don't pay for it.

DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

Users of MATCH SOFTWARE FONTS must accept this disclaimer of 
warranty:"DINOSOTYPE FONT is supplied as is. The author disclaims all 
warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties 
of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose. The author assumes no 
liability for damages, direct or consequential, which may result from the use 
of DINOSOTYPE FONT"

These fonts are "shareware program" and are provided at no charge to the 
user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but please do not 
give it away altered or as part of another system. The essence of "user-
supported" software is to provide personal computer users with quality 
software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
continue to develop new products. If you find this program useful and find
that you are using this font and continue to use this font after a reasonable trial
period, you must make a registration payment of $20 (in US funds) to Match
Software. See order form at the end of this document.

This small $20 fee is intended to pay for this font usage licensing. It is agreed
the user had plenty of time to evaluate it in any way he wanted, and to decide
to register for it. The fonts included with the registered version of this font are
indeed a complementary gift, and do not constitute a new acquisition. It is
understood user will not be entitled for any money back, if for any reason he
did not like one or several of them.

This registration fee will license one copy for use on any one computer at any
one time.  You must treat this software just like a book.  An example is that
this software may be used by any number of people and may be freely moved
from one computer location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it
being used at one location while it's being used at another. Just as a book
cannot be read by two different persons at the same time.

Important message to our foreign customers :
-----------------------------------------

Please DO NOT SEND US ANYTHING ELSE THAN US DOLLARS, OR

would exceed this small $20 price.

LIMITED WARRANTY
----------------

This font is shareware. You had all the time you wanted to experiment  with 
it in any way you wanted to, and for as long as you wanted to, before 
deciding to register. It means you found it satisfactory enough to pay the 
small usage fee.

Therefore, Match Software cannot accept any claim for money back, for any 
reason, after you have decided to, and did register.

If for any reason the registered version of the font was provided to you  on a 
defective media (disk), it will be exchanged for a new one at no  cost.

If you have suggestions for improving this font, we appreciate your 
comments.  It does not mean we will fix or modify the font in the way you  
wish in a given time, or that we must do it in any way. However, if we feel 
the suggestion is appropriate, next version of the font may be inspired from 
these advises.

We decline any responsibility if for any reason this font is put to bad use in 
any way. It worked fine on a regular configuration, and on a regular printer, 
with the most usual software packages. If, for any reason, it could not work 
on your specific configuration, Match Software cannot be held responsible. 
As technical combinations are almost infinite, and because systems evoluate 
in ways we cannot predict, it might happen a new system, or a particular 
configuration,  does not work with a font. For instance, because a new 
version of the system requires a new font format. In general, we will try to 
keep up with the system versions, and eventually offer upgrades, if possible, 
but it does not constitute an obligation, nor would it be the case if you 
acquired a set of seats cover for your specific car, and require they fit any 
new car you may decide to buy later on.

Hardware characteristics may also pose problems. For instance, it appears 
that some ink-jet printers or dot-matrix printers, used with Windows, cannot 
print accurately some complex fonts. It could happen with  "dingbats" fonts, 
made out of small pictures, like Nahkt Hieroglyphs, or  Dinosotype, for 
instance. For some reason, sometimes some sizes show on  the screen as 
little square boxes, and print fine. Or the opposite ; it  shows fine on the 
screen and never prints. Or worse, it does not print either on the screen, nor 
on the printer.  We found no explanation to this phenomenon. It looks very 
much like a solid glitch either in Windows itself, either in the printer's 
drivers. Until His Majesty Microsoft fixes the problem, we are sorry to admit 
we cannot find any way to directly circumvent it (at least easily ; see Q & A in 
OFFER_50.WRI).

Some printers have also some very strange limitations concerning TrueType 
fonts. We had some nightmares with HP-Compatible printers which are not, 
in their native mode, capable of accommodating more than, say, 5 TT fonts. 
If configured as HP clones, however, they would print fine hundreds of 
beautiful TrueType fonts. Think about this kind of glitches, before accusing 
our fonts of not functioning properly.

Another bad use of a font may be generation of counterfeit documents, or any 
kind of falsified printing. We decline any responsibility in such and event.  
Please do not use our fonts for any illegal purpose.

USAGE LICENSING REGISTRATION
----------------------------

If you got this font from a commercial shareware distributor, like  on-disk 
vendors, CD compilations or on-line service, the price you eventually paid 
does not include usage licensing. Commercial distributors  charge you for 
their time spent in selecting, promoting and shipping the  shareware, or any 
other weird reason they might think of, but in no case  for usage fees. In 
other words, should you decide to use this font on  regular or publishing 
purposes, you still must acquire usage licensing by  registering, before doing
so.

This applies especially to desktop publishing, or any kind of publishing.  If
you should use this font in any publishing activity, you must  register, and
also mention in the copyright notices name and origin of  the Match Software
fonts you used. For instance "Bujardet Freres fonts  from Match Software".

Thank-you for complying with these simple rules. If you publish books or
any other intellectual creation, would they be records, software, videos  or
any other creation, you probably want to get recognized for it. Please  do not
deprive us from our small share of it, minuscule registration fee  included.
Thank-you !

                                 Q & A
                                 -----

Here are some questions frequently asked about our fonts, and the answers we
where able to come up at the time. You may want to read, even though you did
not experience any problem. Some of these answers could help you get the best
out of other fonts, by often circumventing difficulties otherwise baffling to
other font houses. This list of questions and answers will be regularly
updated, in order to spare as much as possible aggravation for our customers.
After reading them, please contact us, if anything was still bothering you. We
will do what we can to help you the best way we can. Thank-you for all your
reports.

Q : Under Windows, some fonts do not print at all sizes, or show only on
screen, or the opposite. This happens most often with complex fonts, such as
DinosoType, Bujardet Vignettes of Nahkt Hieroglyphs. Some characters print as
squares, when they appear fine on the screen, or the opposite, or both. It
happens most often when the output is to be made on a dot-matrix printer,
would it be impact or ink-jet.
A : The problem seems to reside within Windows itself, and we where unable to
get any explanation from Microsoft which could help us understand how to solve
the problem. However, as in general this type of fonts are most used on 
isolated basis (letterheads, titles, etc.), it is possible to use another 
approach :
- Create a new document under Windows Paint
- With the TEXT tool, enter the appropriate message
- Copy the image, and paste it into your word processor or desktop publishing
software. Of course, if you use more sophisticated tools than Windows Paint,
like Corel Draw on the PC, the result may be better.

Q : On the Macintosh, I tried to install your TrueType font, but it shows only
as a sort of Helvetica, or Geneva. What's going on ?
A : You probably ran into a font number conflict. In other words, the newly
installed font has probably the same number as some other already installed in
the system. You may want to use a utility to check the numbers of the fonts
installed in your system, maybe FontMaster, which is available in the
shareware circuit, or another more recent.  The way to make sure a font is OK:
- BEFORE a font is installed (if you installed it, remove it from the system
and restart your computer before proceeding), open the suitcase, and in ther,
double-click on the font itself. You should normaly get a little windows,
showing the expected characters.
- Install the font, through the regular procedure you are acustomed to ;
Suitcase if you are lucky, or by placing the suitcase in the system.
- Do the same manipulation as before (opening the font suitcase, then the font
inside). If the font shows OK, it means it should work properly.
If the sample text is showing some sort of Geneva, it means something is
wrong, and the font has the same number as a one installed before.  The only
way to go, if you do not have a special utility to renumber the font, is to
remove any "non system" fonts, and out them aside in another folder, then
restart the computer (when installed, the system contains only Chicago,
Courier, Geneva, Monaco, New York, Symbol, Times. They are the only ones which
should remain).
At this point, you should be able to re-install the new font with no problem.
You can then add the fonts previously set aside, one at a time, until one will
actually do the same as before : show as Geneva. Here is the posing-problem
font. You can get a utilty which can change the fonts numbers, or simply avoid
using the two fonts at the same time

Q : I do not find the promised accented characters. They are not  available
through my regular keyboard. Why is that ?
A : For historical reasons, as computers originated in America, and also
because no one at the beginning thought of using electronic calculators  to
write poems, invitations or books, the ASCII standard did not support
accented characters. Then, as more and more aborigines from France like
Michel Bujardet, or other remote picturesque small countries, started to trade
their usual goose quill for more modern means, they asked for accents. And
also for their own weird keyboards. If you use a Macintosh, use the Keyboard
desk accessory to see what key combinations give you access to the desired
characters.  On the PC, you may want to try all combinations, in conjunction
with the Alt Gr key. You can also load in your word processor the ASCII
document usually provided with our foreign fonts. It will allow you to check
what number punch in on the numeric keypad, while depressing the Alt key, then
release Alt, to get the desired symbol (for instance, Alt-65 generates an
"A").
Under Windows, you have two key combinations doing different things : Alt-XXX
(where XXX represents three digits), and Alt-0XXX where the three digits are
preceded by a 0 (zero). You may want to load in Windows Write the file
WINKEYS.WRI which shows for every code three or four digits the resulting
character.

Q : Why in hell did you choose the same number for one of your fonts than  one
of mine ?
A : This especially goes for the Macintosh, but could happen with Windows or
 ATM as well. Each font has it's own specific number, which the system uses to
 recognize it, and communicate with the printer. If two fonts in the system
 have the same number, strange things will happen : the font may look fine on
 the screen, but print different on the printer. Or the opposite. Look very
 different on the screen than what you expected. This kind of conflict is
 automatically solved by utilities such as Suitcase, an excellent font
 manager, available for Macintosh and Windows. We strongly recommend it's use. 
 Our problem is like Sea Battle : whatever number we choose, there is always a 
 chance some other font designer may have chosen the same. Utilities which can 
 list fonts numbers, and eventually change them, will solve your problem.  If 
 you discover one of our fonts have the same number as one provided by a big 
 company, or, worse, regularly in the system, like Arial under Windows or 
 Chicago on th Mac (which has already been checked for, but one never knows), 
 please report it ASAP. We will change the number at once.

Q : One font crashes the system.
A : Check if the file was not corrupted. A disk error, or some unexpected
manipulations, like switching off the computer with applications still active,
may be the cause. Use the original copy of the font, which you received in
your shareware or registered package. If the problem still persists, please
contact us.

Q : Since I installed your fonts on my Macintosh computer, Suitcase does not
work. The extension is in place, but it does not work.
A : Adding a new set of fonts cannot damage Suitcase. However, a system
crash, or switching off the computer without first doing shut-down in the
special menu, can damage Suitcase. Simply make a new copy from the  original 
Suitcase disk, restart, and it should work again. Some other  inits may 
conflict. We have noticed the same glitch with a scanner  Photoshop add-in, 
which seems to fire bullets at Suitcase, anytime it is  run, and 
systematically destroy it.


Q : I need a font in a language not yet available.
A : Creating fonts for new languages is not only challenging, it is also
culturally very rewarding, very inspiring. We do not always know the language
you plan to use. But if you provide us with the proper information, we will
use it to create a new font. Basically, what we need is a representation as 
detailed as possible of the desired alphabet, along, if it is not a Roman one, 
with the pronounciation of every character. Call us for more details.

Q : I want a font made according to my specifications.
A : If you already have a printout of the desired font, or any graphic
representation that we can use to draw the characters, our regular price for
designing a new font is very reasonable. If you want a creation from scratch,
it will be more difficult. Please call us for a quotation.

Q : How can I obtain a printout of all of your fonts ?
A : You already have a pretty good idea of our fonts from this very document.
However, just send us your complete address, and we will gladly send you a 
sample sheet showing the diversity of Match Software fonts. You may also want 
to look around for a file named 50FNTDEMO.ZIP, or 50FNTDEMO.SIT, which are 
currently available on Compuserve (50FNTDEM) DTP forum, or the equivalent 
forums on America Online. We can also fax you a sample sheet of any specific 
font you want to see. However, if you wish more than 3 fonts, we will still 
send the requested by mail, to avoid excessive phone charges.

Q : You must provide thorough phone hot line support for any brand and type of
computer. If Adobe and others can, why not you ? You should be able to be
reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week !
A : We are sorry, with our small operation, not to be able to compete with
giants who see more money in 10 minutes than we may be able to earn in one
year. However, our prices are lower beyond comparison.  That is also because
you are not paying for million dollars advertisement, and plethoric staffs.
Besides, we are prepared to fix glitches if any, and  gladly accept advises
from our customers. Remember, however, that a font  is somewhat equivalent to
a bumper sticker to an automobile. Please do  not ask us to solve the problems 
generated by your system, no more than  you would think about requiring drive 
lessons from a stickers publisher.   We do our best for our fonts to work 
properly on STANDARD configurations,  including STANDARD printers, STANDARD 
system versions, STANDARD  applications, when our fonts are installed through 
STANDARD procedures.

Q : I have a brand new Epson laser printer, and Word 6 for Windows. I followed
all installation procedures for the printer, and it works beautifully. I
installed your fonts with the Windows Fonts control panel and they seem to be
OK, but they never appear in the application's font menu. What's wrong ?
A : Nothing is wrong, expect the fact that your printer is probably set up in
native mode. It then can accept only a limited number of fonts. If your 
printer is able to support HP emulation (see manual), set it up as an HP 
printer. Setup Windows with the HP printer driver. You should then be happy to 
see our fonts appear in the Word fonts menu next time you run the application.

Q : In your Martian font, you placed a dot above the glipnol character,  and
forgot to put an accent above the weirdoo. It is unforgettable. I am  furious
and you are just as stupid as a bunch of lunar dogs ! You should  be whipped,
and give me my money back, too, plus maybe a little extra,  because I suffered
incredible damage to my much sophisticated sense of  intellectual properness
and inherent graceful sophistication.
A : We are sorry not to know Martian as well as such a refined literate as
your highness.  Please do not blow your desintegrator at us, poor ridiculous 
clumsy uneducated filthy computer groomers. Please consider that ignorance may 
not be such a crime, after all, and have mercy for the less taught. If for any 
reason we committed a mistake in transcribing your native language, be assured 
it is not intentional. Please courteously provide us with the proper 
information, and we will make sure appropriate updates are made. All we know 
of, as humble and insignificant artisans, is the fonts craftsmanship. It is 
not our fault, then, if the subtleties of a foreign language do not strike us 
like light over the saint's head. However, we are bending our knees to the 
more educated. Thank you for  helping us improve.  At the present time, our 
foreign fonts have been  thoroughly reviewed, so they satisfy our customers. 
Some have helped  perfect already very nice fonts. But we will appreciate any 
additional  help !

Q : When I use too many fonts, my printer crashes.
A : Try setting the option "Print TrueType fonts as graphics" in the Windows
Control panel. On the Macintosh, set "Unlimited Downloadable Fonts" in the
Printer Options.

Q : Why do you ask for money for your fonts ? They should be free !
A : There is a strange curse around computer software, these days. Nobody
would ever consider getting a movie for nothing, or walking into a book store 
and require a sample for free. For programs, however, the matter is quite 
different. So many people consider computer software piracy as a light little 
mistake, that eventually, some may indeed start considering software authors 
as thieves, because they pretend to get a small reward for their job. Some 
luminaries (noticeably around GNU project) even have the nerve to play with 
the very strange notion that computer software should only come free, and that 
any commercial distribution, including shareware, has some analogy to a 
rip-off. Fine and good, then, but why do they at the same time insist to get 
paid for their conferencing, or to get royalties from their books ? Match 
Software is a small business based on shareware distribution. Anyone can 
browse at our productions in the same way a reader could read a book as many 
times and as c mpletely as wished, before actually paying for it. Please do 
not pirate us. If you feel a font is really of use, please register. That
small usage fee will help us continue creating new original, exclusive and
fine fonts for you. We sincerely thank all users who have, through their
registration, helped pay the rent, the phone, and the electricity which powers
our equipment while creating all these fonts. Please continue to support the
shareware concept. It is the only way out of the commercial monopolies. Small
software companies are as much a liberty warrant as small book publishers are: 
without them, big companies would have their way, culturally and
financially. Nobody would ever want that to happen !
