8-PIN MATRIX, "DOT-MATRIX" TRUETYPE FONT
This font looks very much like the output of
an old 8-Pin dot-matrix printer, like the
Epson FX-80. Very interesting to re-create
documents looking like "old" computers, or
computerized bills. Shareware $20. Upon
registration, get whole collections of new
fonts, including many other original art
fonts, or many exclusive foreign fonts.
For PostScript T1 format, look for 8PNMX_T1.
